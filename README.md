# keePebble
A Google Keep client for Pebble smartwatches, based on *Keep for Pebble* by matejdro (original thread [here](https://forums.pebble.com/t/android-root-keep-for-pebble-display-google-keep-notes-on-your-pebble/4333)). 

To run keePebble you'll need an Android device with Google Keep, root access, and matejdro's PebbleKeep [Android app](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/6999250/Dialer/Keep/PebbleKeep.apk).

Please note that keePebble is still in development. Be prepared for bugs, messy code, dirty hacks, missing features, etcetera.

Most of the backend code is identical to the original Pebble Keep, while much of the UI has been rewritten to match the PebbleOS 3 UI.
