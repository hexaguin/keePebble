# keePebble
A Google Keep client for Pebble smartwatches, based on *Keep for Pebble* by matejdro (original thread [here](https://forums.pebble.com/t/android-root-keep-for-pebble-display-google-keep-notes-on-your-pebble/4333)). 

To run KeePebble you'll need an Android device with Google Keep, root access, and matejdro's PebbleKeep [Android app](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/6999250/Dialer/Keep/PebbleKeep.apk).

Please note that KeePebble is still in development. Be prepared for bugs, messy code, dirty hacks, missing features, etcetera.
